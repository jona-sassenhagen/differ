The Israelites are multiplied in Egypt. They are oppressed by a new king, who commandeth all their male children to be killed.
1:1 These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into Egypt with Jacob: they went in every man with his household:
1:2 Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda,
1:3 Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,
1:4 Dan, and Nephthali, Gad and Aser.
1:5 And all the souls that came out of Jacob's thigh, were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt.
1:6 After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation,
1:7 The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.
1:8 In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph:
1:9 And he said to his people: Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we.
1:10 Come let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.
1:11 Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens: and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom, and Ramesses.
